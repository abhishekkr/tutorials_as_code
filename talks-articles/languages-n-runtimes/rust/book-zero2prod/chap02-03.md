## Chapter.2 Building an Email Newsletter

> building an MVP to learn

* Newsletter features

> * Allow Visitors, subscribing to a Newsletter
> * Allow Newsletter Owner, send emails to all subscribers
> * Allow Subscriber, to unsubscribe.
> MVP is for a single newsletter, without subscriber segmentation or tracking


## Chapter.3 Allow Visitors to Subscribe

> user flow: visitors to subscribe via a web form calling backend API `POST /subscription`

* need a web framework, testing strategy, db crate, migrations, etc.

* `actix_web` framework would be used, it's based on tokio (so would need add both to dependencies) and is highly performant

* `cargo check` for code vaildity & `cargo build` to check+gen binary

* `cargo install cargo-edit` provides `cargo add actix-web --vers 4.0.0` like commands to add deps via cli

* `cargo run` to build & run

* for `actix_web`

> * `HttpServer` takes care of binding, connection concurrency, TLS, etc.
>
> * `App` passed to it has all application logic on routing, middlewares, request handlers, etc.
>
> * request handler async function `greet()` takes `HttpRequest` and returns anything implementing `Responder` trait
>
> * request handlers can have a wide range of signatures

* `#[tokio::main]` macro allows `main` to be async as it calls async `HttpServer::run`; Rust's stdlib doesn't include a default async runtime

* if used `cargo expand` with nightly build, can see macro expansion of the code i.e. uses entire block and blocks thread on it

* in `health_check()` handler, have param `_req` as unused need to be prefixed with underscore; `route()` need to be above `/{name}` so wildcard doesn't match

* while laying down structure of code, can add `todo!()` as body for placeholder function definitions.. to make it gracefully panic depicting it's WIP

### Integration Tests

* can have next to code in an embedded test module as

```
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*; // getting the code that is to be tested
    // now test logic
}
```

* as document tests like

```
/// Check if number is negative.
/// ```
/// use myrs::is_neg;
///
/// assert!(is_neg(-1));
/// assert!(!is_neg(1));
/// ```
pub fn is_neg(n: i64) -> bool {
    n < 0
}
```

* or in an external `tests` folder in parent dir of `src`; used for **integration tests** or **unit tests for Public calls**

> all these have different visibility rules; embedded test module has privileged access to code i.e. to private constructs as well

* `use sample_project::main;` as of now would fail with `use of undeclared crate or module`; so we need library crate for flows with integration tests

> adding `src/server.rs` & enabling it in `Cargo.toml` by adding path below `[lib]` section

* to run our app (`start_server()`) as background task, can use `tokio::spawn()` that takes a future and without waiting hands over for polling.. so runs concurrently with downstream tests

* while laying down structure of code, can add `todo!()` as body for placeholder function definitions.. to make it gracefully panic depicting it's WIP


### Refactor/Clean-up

* binding to a custom port

> * if use port `0`, OS would assign an available port by itself..
> been done passing `TcpListener`; instead of `bind(address)` chained with `listen(tcpListener)` and in usage as

```
let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:0").expect("Failed for bind..");
let port = listener.local_addr().unwrap().port();
let server = sample_project::start_server(listener).expect("Failed to start server");
let _ = tokio::spawn(server);
format!("127.0.0.1:{}", port)
```

* using `std::env` for env var configured custom address value


### BackTo: Subscribe to Newsletter

* Visit a web page with form to `POST /subscription` call to api.

* API reading data of form and persist at DB; manage migrations.

> test for side-effects & avoid weird interactions with DB


### Use HTML Forms

* Add `test_subscribe_success()` & `test_subscribe_fail_missing_email()` for checks; with use of `vec!` for table-driven tests.

* add route for `/subscription` with handler `subscribe()`
