* Allows to achieve variable reduction for ML computation.

> * Can also be used for least sqaure linear regression, image compression and denoising data.
>
> * Offers various useful applications in signal processing, psychology, sociology, climate, atomospheric science, statistics and astronomy.

* SVD is a matrix decomposition method. It's stable as all matrices have an SVD.

* It helps reduce a big matrix to it's constituent parts to make calculations simpler.

* SVD has been known under names like `factor analysis`, `principal component decomposition` and `empirical orthogonal function`; mathematically equivalent and need grip over matrix algebra and vector calculus.

* SVD decomposes a larger matrix into 3 matrices as `A = USVáµ€`

> * A is main `m x n` matrix
>
> * U is `m x n` orthogonal matrix; is left Singular Vector
>
> * S `Sigma` is an `n x n` diagonal matrix; Si are called Singular Values
>
> * V is `n x n` orthogonal matrix, transposed; is right Singular Vector
>
> Identity Matrix is a square matrix with diagonal elements 1 and others 0.
> Diagonal Matrix has all entries other than diagonal as 0.
> Singular Matrix has determinant 0 or a sqaure matrix which doesn't have a matrix inverse.

* Sum of squares of `Singular Values` from diagonal matrix should be equal to toal variance in `A`. Truncated SVD can contain major portion of Variance.

* `scipy` provides with `svd()` and `TruncatedSVD()` methods to aid
