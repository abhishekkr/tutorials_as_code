> Level Design is about functional, gameplay-focused planning and creation of Game spaces.

* Need to: 1) Establish level design requirements. 2) Define level's broad content plan. 3) Fin content making strategy and order.

* Level Design is not Environmental Art or Worldbuilding; not the code side of Env building.

* Establish core rules for each game's own Level Design; to ensure consistency for the gameplay feel throughout iterations.
> * Like John Romero (Doom)'s rules: be strict about texture alignment; use contrast everywhere (light-dark, open-cramped); where player can see.. can reach; several secret areas on each level; level flow designed to encourage revisit; easily recognizable landmarks for navigation.
>
> * Design Goal Ruless intended for Skill; Achievement; Legibility; Intrigue; Story; Worldbuilding. Rules should have UX Goals.

* LEVEL is a `Piece of World`; `Flow of Story`; `Currency for Intrigue`; & `Familiarity for Gameplay of Similar Genres`
> Does it tell a story or create mystery?
> What experiences and challenges are part of it?
> What need to be consistent? What need to grow or diminish?
