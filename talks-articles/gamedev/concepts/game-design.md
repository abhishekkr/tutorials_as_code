### For Solo Game Developers

#### Subtractive Design for Scope Management

> *making small games is about focus on fewer things; not making a short game*

* Game with Fewer/No Characters
> * No character game could be like a Player Sim, where Player explores the world to figure out the story of the abandoned place.

* Game with Smaller Worlds limiting Level Design Artwork
> * No OPEN WORLD, unless can do GENIUS PROCEDURAL GENERATION or LEVEL REUSE.
> * Mechanics can trigger Repeat Play, like for games involving Crop/Plants yield.
> * Difficulty could be used for Level Resue; as in Souls-Like Game re-run of same level on Death to pick up dropped XP.

* Games with Less/Specific Mechanics
> * If game has multiple characters.. if Game mechanics make it out for interaction driven movement instead of direct character control. So other UI elements (easier to animate) can replace actual character movements.
> * Even Action games (Backpack Hero, Diablo) if made focus for Inventory Management, can be done quickly. This is GENRE DE-SCOPING, like Tower Defence came from RTS Games.

**Focus on Mechanics, Levels, Characters, Story, Systems and Interface. Think what you can get creative with to reduce scope. Think what is of higher priority for Gameplay.**
