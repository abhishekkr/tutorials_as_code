## What is Playwright?

### Playwright is For You...

* If you need a Framework for Web Testing or Web Task Automation.
* Want to write code once and use for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari or any WebKit. So support Native Android or iPhone render emulation.
* Need headless browser execution.
* Want to make it work on Linux, Mac and Windows alike. So can run in C-I pipelines and simple containers anywhere.
* Want to use the framework in TypeScript, Javascript, Python, Dot-Net or Java.

It's build to suit End-to-End testing. The library can easily help with all sorts of web app automation tasks.

It auto waits for elements to be actionable and has clean introspection events; so avoid explicit timeouts.

It's written to suit the dynamic web apps.

Test retry strategy and capturing execution traces are easily configurable.

Playwright runs tests out of process; thus can support multiple tabs, origins and users for different scenarios in a single test. Using real browsers, can perform trusted events. Can pierce shadow DOM and enter frames seamlessly.

It creates a Browser context for each test, similar to a temporary profile.. providing test isolation.

It can save the authentication state of browser context and reuse in all tests; allowing skipping pre-requisites and yet mantaining isolation.

Has a set of support tools that can help you Generate tests by recording actions. An Inspector to help you inspect page, click points and logs while stepping through execution. And a helpfu trace viewer for failed tests.
