# Intro to Ansible

## getting started

* default openssh, falls to paramiko from 1.3 onwards
* if SFTP not supported, specify to use SCP in config file
* default PKI, if using Password --ask-pass; if using sudo with password --ask-sudo-pass
* transports are pluggable, can manage things locally
* can manage chroot, lxc, jail
* ansible-pull can make nodes phone-home to do scehduled git-checkouts for config directives from central repo

* **example01** trials; has a basic inventory file, commands in my.source and dumb playbook

* strict host key checking could be disabled from "~/.ansible.cfg" or ENV(ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING); but don't do that

---

## intro to inventory

* /etc/ansible/hosts (Inventory file), INI file; groups can have common nodes; nodes can have ssh ports and jumper info; nodes can be regex-ized

* example node config
```
localhost ansible_python_interpreter=python2 ansible_ssh_port=22 ansible_ssh_user=localuser ansible_ssh_private_key_file="~/.ssh/id_rsa_nopass"
local.node ansible_python_interpreter=python2 ansible_ssh_port=22 ansible_ssh_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_user=localuser ansible_ssh_private_key_file="~/.ssh/id_rsa_nopass"
```
> ansible_ssh_host, ansible_ssh_port, ansible_ssh_user, ansible_ssh_pass, ansible_sudo_pass, ansible_connection, ansible_ssh_private_key_file, ansible_shell_type, ansible_python_interpreter, ansible_(.*)_interpreter

```
[myservers]
my[01:10].service.local

[dbs]
db-[a:f].service.local

[monitor]
local.node ansible_connection=local
remote.node ansible_connection=ssh

```

* can assign key-val groups to host here itself to be used in playbooks, or can be applied to entire group as well

```
[farAwayNodes]
node01 http_port=8880 maxRequestPerChild=820
node02 http_port=8881 maxRequestPerChild=910

[farAwayNodes:vars]
http_log=/var/logs/http.log
```

* groups of groups, then group var

```
[regionX]
node01

[regionY]
node01
node02

[regionVWXYZ:children]
regionV
regionW
regionX
regionY
regionZ

[regionVWXYZ:vars]
monitor=true

[regionQRSTUVWXYZ:children]
reqionQRSTU
regionVWXYZ
```

* splitting out host and group specific data; keep data in var file in YAML... so for just above inventory+var file... split would be like
> /etc/ansible/group_vars/regionVWXYZ/<property-group-filename>
> /etc/ansible/host_vars/node01/<property-group-filename>

* Ansible Vault could be used to encrypt any <group_vars>/ or <host_vars>/ inventory var; and other stuff as well

---

## patterns

* are a way to decide which host to apply particular config to, example
```
ansible '*ui*' -m ping
```

* could mention a group or a particular host level pattern
> for all hosts: all or '*'
> set of hosts: '*httpnode*:*dbnode*'

* groups separated by colon indicate "OR", means host may be in either

* exclude groups as ``` httpnodes:!phoenix ```

* intersection of two groups ``` http8080nodes:&http80nodes ```

* combos ``` dbnodes:httpnodes:&staging:!phoenix ```; all httpnodes and dbnodes common from staging but not phoenix

* start the regex pattern with '~' ``` ~(http|db)nodes ```

* can add exclusion criteria even by --limit flag ``` ansible-playbook site.yml --limit production ```

---

## ad-hoc intro

* run in parallel forks:  ``` ansible phoenix -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10 ```

* above can be set in Ansible-config-file as ``` forks=10 ``` if to be made as a default

* running specific module on nodes via ad-hoc; ``` ansible httpnodes -m shell -a 'echo $HOME' ```

* managing FILEs
> * copying files across to nodes ``` ansible httpnodes -m copy "src=/httpnode/hosts dest=/etc/hosts" ```
>
> * using playbooks can utilize "template"
>
> * can play with file permission, type, owner and things using "file" module
>
> ```
> ansible webservers -m file -a "dest=/foo/bar/huh mode=663"
> ansible webservers -m file -a 'dest=$HOME/.ssh mode=700 owner=$USER group=$USER state=directory'
> ```
>
> * or delete ``` ansible foobarS -m file -a "dest=/tmp/foo.bin state=absent" ```

* managing PKGs
> * install ``` ansible monitors -m yum -a "name=logrotate state=installed" ```
>
> * specific install ``` ansible monitors -m yum -a "name=logrotate-1.2 state=installed" ```
>
> * update install ``` ansible monitors -m yum -a "name=logrotate state=latest" ```
>
> * uninstall ``` ansible monitors -m yum -a "name=logrotate state=removed" ```

* users and groups
```
ansible all -m user -a "name=foo password=<crypted password here>"
ansible all -m user -a "name=foo state=absent"
```

* SCM ``` ansible httpnode01 -m git -a "repo=git://github.com/abhishekkr/playlist.git dest=/opt/myapp version=HEAD" ```

* managing service
```
ansible webservers -m service -a "name=nginx state=stopped"
ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"
ansible webservers -m service -a "name=logrotate state=restarted"
```

* send long running operations to background
> run task bg, no poll (same job-id on all hosts) ``` ansible all -B 3600 -a "/tmp/foo.bin --install" ```
> check on later ``` ansible all -m async_status -a "jid=123456789" ```
> run task bg, but poll ``` ansible all -B 1800 -P 60 -a "/tmp/foo.bin --install" ```
> the number with -B in above statements is max-time to allow run in Seconds
> -P decides to poll in what Seconds
> use high enough Fork value to put it to use
> playbooks support background-ing as well

* checking up facts on node ``` ansible all -m setup ```

## Configuration

* Changes can be made and used in a configuration file which will be processed in the following order:
> * ANSIBLE_CONFIG (an environment variable)
> * ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
> * .ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
> * /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
> prior to v1.5, env var was overridden by current-dir config file

* general defaults '[defaults]'
> * action_plugins
> * ansible_managed
> * ask_pass=True ; ask_sudo_pass=True ; display_skipped_hosts=True ; deprecation_warnings=True;
> * executable=/bin/bash ; hash_behaviour=replace (or merge) ; hostfile=/etc/ansible/hosts
> * jinja2_extensions = jinja2.ext.do,jinja2.ext.i18n
> * library = /usr/share/ansible
> * log_path=/var/log/ansible.log
> * hosts=* ; poll_interval=15 ; private_key_file=/path/to/file.pem ; remote_port = 22
> * roles_path = /opt/mysite/roles:/opt/othersite/roles
> some other defaults and accelerate mode config
